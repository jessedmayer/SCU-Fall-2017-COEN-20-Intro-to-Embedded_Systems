Textbook problems from ARM Assembly for Embedded Applications 3rd edition, by Daniel W. Lewis

You are expected to have read all of chapters 1 and 2 BEFORE the first day of class. Given the small size of the book (6"x9") and the 12 point type, those 30 pages won't take long to read.
 
You should then try to solve most of the problems at the end of chapter 2 by no later than the end of the first week of classes. At a minimum, do problems 1-14, 17, and 18. Problems 10, 13, 14, 17 and 18 may require a little more thought, but are not terribly difficult. Problems 15 and 16 require generalizing the algorithms so that they can be applied to number systems other than binary. 
  
Write your problem solutions using a word processor and upload the document as a .txt, .doc, .docx, or .pdf file to Camino no later than the posted deadline. Do NOT submit a scan of handwritten work - it will not be accepted. Solutions will be posted on Camino after class.
 
If you have time, problems 19-23 are for those of you who enjoy programming. Implementing (and thoroughly testing) the algorithms of chapter 2 as computer programs is one of the best ways to be sure that you have a clear understanding of how the algorithms work.
